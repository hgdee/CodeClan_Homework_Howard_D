 * Question 16. [Tough]
Find the proportion of employees in each department who are grade 1.
Hints
Think of the desired proportion for a given department as the number of employees in that department who are grade 1, divided by the total number of employees in that department.


You can write an expression in a SELECT statement, e.g. grade = 1. This would result in BOOLEAN values.


If you could convert BOOLEAN to INTEGER 1 and 0, you could sum them. The CAST() function lets you convert data types.


In SQL, an INTEGER divided by an INTEGER yields an INTEGER. To get a REAL value, you need to convert the top, bottom or both sides of the division to REAL.
